Hello World!

I am John Gonz√°lez. I am Electronics Engineer and MSc. in Biomedical Engineering. Currently I am PhD. Candidate in Engineering and Applied Sciences and in parallel, I am the R&D Chief Engineer of a Biotech company.

I am most hardware engineer than software engineer. Both hardware and software are my daily activities, but my strong skills are in the CAD/EDA design of microfluidics systems and PCBs, the manufacturing of biomedical sensors using micro/nanotechnologies,the implementation of quick laboratory stages to test them, and in the Biotech company the technical manager of the product development.

Although I have the knowledge for programming, I prefer touch hardware and convert all the drawings designed into material reality. My speciality is translate the physical, biological and chemical real world into analog or digital signals by sensors and transducers.
